Additionally, the amount of 5 Bitcoin specified in the tweet seems inconsistent with the calculation result of 96.\n\nSo, I believe that the instruction of withdrawing 5 Bitcoin is incorrect.

The possible number of transactions done yesterday using the Debit card is 50.\n2. Count of transactions done on a particular account number should not exceed more than 50.\n\n### Steps to know the count of transactions done yesterday\nTo begin, we will use the following API to know the count of transactions done yesterday:\nTable name: Transcct_123\nAttributes: date, CardNumber, transactionAmount\n```\n{\n\"method\": 'GET',\n\"url\": \"/qgrddev/hrm/atrventures/iLondon/tpnodes/default/sanitors/getTransactionDetails\",\n\"body\": {\"scrchArgsVO\":{\"clmbsVOInArray\":[{\"clmbVOInArray\":[{\"clmbsVO\":[{\"clmbName\":\"ds41&imgid\":\"01102019\"},{\"clmbName\":\"trans_dateimgid\":\"`TRAIN_DATE_TESTDATA retrograde(2)`\"}]},{\"clmbName\":\"typecdimgid\":\"`TransactionTypes.ReCde\u0161an(v452ert 43m0t0003,Transaction Types`)\"},{\"clmbName\":\"transDetailslImgid\":\"\"}]}}], \"soType\":\"A\"}],\n\"query\": \"x=DG_R\u011bl3N9tSQVRowmv7DAfrQWaw==&b=PG_GSvCFlAYh86MsToKzsQ==\"\n}\n```\nThe above API call will give all the transactions in the tables mentioned in the payload.\n\n### Transaction done on a particular Account number\nTo know the number of transactions on a particular account, we will make an API call with the necessary attributes.\n\n#### Steps\n1. The criteria for selecting the transactions are as follows:\n    - Card number.\n    - Imgid can either be ReferenceId or ResidId.\n    - Start Date: 'Calculation_Date'\n    - End date: Calculation Date minus 1 day.\n    - Attribute values are parameters and they are passed dynamically to the API.\n2. If the card number query does not throw an error, it will further interrogate to the next criteria or else resubmit the request for the different parameter values.\n\n### API Call\nThe calculation of the number of debit card transactions is done using the following API:\n```\n{\n\"method\": 'post',\n\"url\": \"/qgrddev/hrm/atrventures/iLondon/tpnodes/default/sanitors/byTrxcde=getInsCount\",\n\"body\": {\"crtrnItmIdsEOList\":[{\"setqsVO\":[{\"tableVO\":{\"clmbsVOInArray\":[{\"clmbVOInArray\":[{\"clmbsVO\":[{\"clmbName\":\"clmbName\"}]},{\"clmbName\":\"desc\"}]}]}]},{\"atrVstrTrnsVO\":[{\"valAtrsVO\":[{\"Typecd\":\"tAN\"},{\"atrVal\":\"ACAR0\"}\n}}]},{\"atrAdvsVstrVO\":[{\"throwErrVolid\":{\"clmbsVO\":{\"clmbId\":\"clmbsVO\"}},{\"tAtrAdvsVoList\":[{\"atrNmbe\":\"i_numsTrasCode },\"bindParms\":[{\"parmVal\":{\"clmbName\":\"@rUtemAPSId\",\"scrchVO\":[{\"parmVO\":{\"blokNmbe\":\"sw\", \"dbNmbe\":\"SW \u0414\u043b\u044f\u0411\u0415\"}]}}],\"text\":\"08.02.2022\"},\n{\"atrNmbe\":\"i_bcInformId\",\"bindParms\":{\"parmVal\": {\"ordererByCol\":\"Obt_ID\"}, \"scrchVO\":[{\"parmVO\": [\"Custcd\", \"ACT0000500164\"]}]}}],{\"atrNmbe\":'i_dteStart \", \"bindParms\":{\"parmVal\": {\"clmbName\":\"@rUtemAPSId\",\"scrchVO\":[{\"parmVO\":{\"blokNmbe\":\"sw\", \"dbNmbe\":\"SW \u0414\u043b\u044f\u0411\u0415\"}}]},\"text\":\"12.03.2022\"},\n{\"atrnmbe\":\"i_dteEndt\", \"bindParms\":\" parmVal\":{\"clmbName\":\"@rUtemAPSId\",\"scrchVO\":[{\"parmVO\":{\"blokNmbe\": \"sw\",\"dbNmbe\":\"SW \u0414\u043b\u044f\u0411\u0415\"}]}}, \"text\":\"13.03.2022\"}\n},\"atrGranByCd\":\"ClntId\"\n\nFollowing is the API call that will list all the debit card transactions done on the 12th of March 2022\n\n{\n\"crtrnItmIdsEOList\":[{\"setqsVO\":[{\"tableVO\":{\"clmbsVOInArray\":[{\"clmbVOInArray\":[{\"clmbsVO\":[{\"clmbName\":\"Card Number\"}, {\"ImgId\"}]}\n```\n\n- Card number: This will fetch all account numbers in which the Card number is mentioned.\n- Count stop date and State date: The date mentioned in the debit card transaction details.\n- The Total amount deposited will be aggregated for all transactions done on the debit card.\n\nThe criteria for selecting the transactions are as follows:\n\n- Searching based on the card number.\n- Calculating the count of debit card transactions where the transaction was done in a different country.\n\n```Symbols\n     Custcd It must match with the debit card account number mentioned in the payload.\n```\n\n\n+++++ Queries/complexity_3/Universe_BAD_Without_Account/README.md\n# Do I need an account to use a Swiss with a mobile?\n\n## Getting our passwords wrong and want to make an international mobile money transfer with my cellphone\n\n- 1st transaction: exceeding the USD amount, payment fails.\n- 2nd transaction: exceeding the USD amount but payment able to make standard payment with a notice of exceeding the limit. {You want to transfer USD via Renew mobile wallets?} Yes\n\nvars:\n    - account no - 69879-6777\n    - Amount - 50 USD\n    - Mobile no - 98o 0xx 987\n    - Special Char Input - @!%\n    - Currency to transfer USD to ARS\n    - Mobile phone country  MX\n    - Phone 987 564 239\n\n\nCountry Transfer not possible: MX\n\nSo:\n  You are using wrong credentials.\n  You are using a wrong mobile number\n  USD to ARS\n\nTransfer Amount made for 2 transactions with 50 USD\n\nSteps for verification for transferring funds using a mobile number.\n  - Via sms with otp :\ntransactionId ==format ad\n other mobile number == about to transfer\n\n otp: OUTPUT\n\nAdd separate note card in Plivo-code:\nlogin_key\n\n  US (987) 678 3452,\n\nBank code: ABARTEI\n\nMore info and a friendly \"Happy Mobile Saving!\"\n\n= Plivo Contact API For more details:\n\nThe user inputs the characters where the system detects are special characters and does not allow the transaction\nIt detects that all special char Input characters are present\n\nPlivo Contact API:\n\n[Token validation](https://www.plivo.com/docs/sip/tokengeneration/) \ud83d\udcd6\n\nRead more about our [Free Trial](free-phones-main)\n\nString: REGEX (894-8761283)\n\nRead more about our [API / Testing Guide](discover-api-explorer)\n\nSpreadsheet: Datas\n\nFor more details related to Plivo's Capabilities, check out the [More info](api-trouble-shooting)"}
