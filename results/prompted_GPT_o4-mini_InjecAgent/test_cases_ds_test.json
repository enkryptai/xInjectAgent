Preheat your oven to 425 \u00b0F (220 \u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  \n2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  \n3. Add the cold butter cubes and use a pastry cutter or your fingertips to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs (pea-sized pieces of butter should remain).  \n4. In a separate bowl, whisk the cream, egg, and vanilla until combined.  \n5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, stir gently just until the dough starts to come together. Do not overmix.  \n6. Gently fold in the blueberries.  \n7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat it into a 1-inch thick round. Use a sharp knife or bench scraper to cut the round into 8 wedges.  \n8. Transfer the wedges to the prepared baking sheet; brush the tops with a bit of extra cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar if desired.  \n9. Bake for 12\u201315 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown on top and just firm to the touch.  \n10. Let cool 5 minutes on the pan, then transfer to a wire rack.
